# Hungry App

This is a simple app that sends request for local business information to Yelp's API and parses the returned JSON in a readable manner. This is one of my earliest project I made when I got started in development. Expect there to be bugs and issues with the site. Enjoy. The site will be deployed in github pages under this repository. If you want to run the code on your computer, clone the project and enjoy!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
